                <h2>Current Position and Educational Background</h2>
              
                <p>Claudia Bullock currently serves as a Contracting Officer's Representative for the
                        Division of Quality Improvement (DQI), CMS Kansas City.  She earned a BA in
                        Philosophy, from the University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP), graduating
                        with departmental honors, in 1981.  Subsequently, she was trained as a 
                        Computer Programmer, graduating from Computer Learning Center (Springfield, 
                        VA) with honors in Computer Programming in 1984, and later earning a BS in 
                         Computer & Information Science, from the University of Maryland, University 
                        College (UMUC), where she graduated with honors in 1995.

                <h2>Work History</h2>
                <p>After obtaining her Certificate in Computer Programming, Claudia began a career
                        as a Computer Programmer.  Prior to joining CMS, Claudia gained years of
                        experience in this capacity working for Analytic Services (ANSER), Lerner Law
                        Book, Co., Washington Law Book Co., and the DC Government
                        Commission of Public Health Data Center, before finally beginning work at CMS
                        headquarters in Baltimore, MD, in October of 1995.  Claudia joined CMS (which
                        was then called HCFA) as a Computer Specialist, participating in the primary
                        work of the Research Support Systems Branch, which was the fulfillment of 
                        requests for Medicare and Medicaid data, in order to support research.  In order
                        to support the requests for Medicaid data she was often required to write adhoc
                        programs to manipulate data from the Medicaid Statistical Information System 
                        (MSIS) files, or the State Medicaid Research (SMRF) files.  In this regard, She
                        was used as a programming resource for offices such as the OIG, GAO, and the
                        HCFA Medicaid Bureau.  Programs were written in an IBM Mainframe 
                        environment, using COBOL, SAS, and JCL.
                            </p>
                <p>Claudia transferred from the Central Office in Baltimore, to the Kansas City
                        Regional Office in 1996, after her husband was accepted to the Osteopathich
                        Medical School in Kansas City.  Claudia continued to work as a computer 
                        programmer in Kansas City for many years, serving as a general regional 
                        resource providing support for a variety of projects.  The programming necessary
                        for completion of these projects was primarily done in SAS, both on the
                        Mainframe and on the PC.  Primary duties during this time included working with
                        epidemiologists and statisticians on studies that utilized CMS data files, and
                        which were published in a variety of peer-reviewed medical journals.  Claudia
                        performed the necessary programming for these studies, and also acted as co-author,
                        writing the Methodology section, to explain what data was used, and how
                        it was manipulated.  Since coming to Kansas City in 1996, most of Claudia's
                        career with CMS has been spent working out of the Kansas City Regional Office,
                        however, there was a 2 year period during which she worked in the Philadelphia
                        Regional Office as a computer programmer under a lateral transfer arrangement,
                        which made it possible for her to stay with CMS while her husband embarked on
                        an osteopathic internship located in Philadelphia.
                            </p>
                <p>Eventually Claudia transitioned from the role of Computer Programmer, to her
                        current role as Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), at the request of her
                        supervisor and co-workers.  There was a need for additional CORs at the time
                        due to excessive workload, and it was observed that her strong Analytic
                        background would serve as an asset for doing this type of work.
                            </p>
                <p>Claudia has served as a COR for the QIO program since the 8th SOW.  Currently,
                        in the 11th SOW, her primary role is QIN-QIO COR for the Great Plains Quality 
                        Innovation Network (GPQIN), which covers the states of North Dakota, South
                        Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.  She also serves as a member of the DQI
                        Internal Quality Improvement Program Team (IQIPT), and on Aim Teams 'A' and
                        'B'.

                 <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>Claudia's personal interests include the practice of nutritional excellence in order
                        to achieve optimal health and longevity.  She is a participant in the Nutritarian
                        Women's Health Study (NWHS), which is a long term observational study on the effect of
                        a Nutritarian diet on the occurrence, recurrence, and progression of chronic
                        diseases (including all forms of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke).

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <div class="Future text">
                <p>Claudia is scheduled to retire from her current position on leap day (February 29th)
                        of 2020, at which time she plans to take a big leap, by returning to a career in 
                        computer programming. Although it has been quite a few years since she has worked
                        as a programmer, she truly misses it, as it is the type of work that she has always
                        enjoyed the most. In order to facilitate this transition, Claudia feels blessed and
                        honored to be a current participant in the Summer 2018 LaunchCode cohort in Kansas
                        City.  LaunchCode is providing her with exactly the right training that she needs in 
                        order to bring her skills up to date, as well as providing her with a pathway to 
                        re-enter the world of computer programming.
